        <br>Ghostbusters is a licensed game by Activision based on the movie of the same name. 
            It was designed by David Crane, produced by Brad Fregger, and released for several
            home computer platforms in 1984, and later for video game console systems.</br>
           
        Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. 
        From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for "ghost alarms",
         as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route 
         is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. 
         Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the 
         haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will 
         take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must
          then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once 
          activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture 
          will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and
           new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily
            sliming one of the Ghostbusters).
